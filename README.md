# Project Milestones and Minimum Deliverables for Large Multimodal Models for Tropical Disease Diagnosis

Below are the milestones for the project, each with a description, minimum deliverables required to gather meaningful feedback, and their alignment with the sprint backlog. The milestones are tailored for a student-level project with a team of 4 members, each contributing 2 hours per week (8 hours per sprint), and are designed to ensure progress toward a multimodal diagnosis system for dengue fever, a technical report, and project management documentation.

## Milestones

| **Milestone #** | **Description** | **Minimum Deliverables for Feedback** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **M1** | **Project Setup and Initial Research**<br>Establish the project foundation by setting up version control and finalizing key technical choices (LMM and vector database). Feedback ensures the chosen technologies are appropriate. | - Initialized Git repository with README and .gitignore.<br>- Document detailing the selected LMM (e.g., CLIP, LLaVA) with rationale (pros/cons, accessibility).<br>- Document detailing the selected vector database (e.g., FAISS, Pinecone) with rationale (scalability, compatibility). | 
| **M2** | **System Design and Data Collection Plan**<br>Define the system architecture and finalize plans for collecting dengue fever data. Feedback validates the system design and data strategy. | - High-level system architecture diagram (e.g., using Draw.io) showing components (data input, RAG, output).<br>- Documented data collection plans for dengue fever, specifying sources (e.g., ChestX-ray14, Kaggle) and preprocessing steps. |
| **M3** | **Data Collection Completion and Environment Setup**<br>Complete data collection for both diseases and set up the development environment. Feedback ensures data quality and environment readiness. | - Preprocessed datasets for dengue fever (at least 500 samples each, split into train/test sets).<br>- Development environment setup with a sample script running successfully (e.g., a basic LMM inference test).<br>- Updated Git repository with dataset samples and environment setup scripts. |
| **M4** | **RAG System Implementation and Initial Training**<br>Implement and test the RAG system, and complete initial model training. Feedback validates system functionality and early model performance. | - Working RAG system prototype that processes sample text and image inputs to produce a diagnosis output.<br>- Initial training results with performance metrics (e.g., accuracy on a validation set).<br>- Updated Git repository with RAG code and training logs. | 
| **M5** | **System Integration and Evaluation**<br>Integrate the RAG model into a usable system (e.g., a simple interface) and complete model evaluation. Feedback ensures the system is usable and performs adequately. | - Functional diagnosis system (e.g., a Streamlit app) that accepts text and image inputs and outputs diagnoses.<br>- Evaluation report with metrics (e.g., accuracy, F1 score) for dengue fever test datasets.<br>- Draft technical report sections (introduction, methods, results). |
| **M6** | **Final Deliverables and Documentation**<br>Finalize the diagnosis system, technical report, and project management documentation. Feedback confirms project completion and quality. | - Complete diagnosis system with user-tested interface or API.<br>- Final technical report covering use cases, data, models, and results.<br>- Project management documentation detailing Agile and DevOps practices.<br>- Fully updated Git repository with all code, datasets, and documentation. |
