Rash is common in dengue fever, consisting of transient ﬂushing erythema on the ﬁrst and second days, followed by maculopapular or morbilliform skin ﬁndings and petechiae and rounded islands of sparing occurring after 3–5 days of the disease.1 Maculopapular rashes in infectious diseases are thought to be caused by adaptive immune responses against pathogens, commonly viruses, mediated by T-lymphocytes alone or both T-cell and B-cell responses that release the mediators, toxins, and antibodies.2 In dengue fever, it is hypothesized that the rash is due to inﬂammatory cell inﬁltra- tion and dermal edema after increased vessel permeability.3 Urticaria occurs in the superﬁcial dermis and is caused by vascular dilation and ﬂuid leakage into the skin, triggered by histamine and vasodilator mediators released from mast cells and basophils.4 Infections can trigger urticaria.",
