Severe dengue is also regularly observed during primary infection  of infants born to dengue-immune mothers. Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of  infection has been hypothesized (51,52) as a mechanism to explain severe dengue in  the course of a secondary infection and in infants with primary infections. In this model,  non-neutralizing, cross-reactive antibodies raised during a primary infection, or acquired  passively at birth, bind to epitopes on the surface of a heterologous infecting virus and  facilitate virus entry into Fc-receptor-bearing cells.",

Finally, prime-boost strategies  combining vaccines of distinct formulations are under investigation. 6.2.3 Challenges  Since dengue is caused by four serologically related viruses, the first major problem  in developing a dengue vaccine is to develop not just one immunogen but four  immunogens that will induce a protective immune response against all four viruses  simultaneously. Therefore, the vaccine must be tetravalent. Interference between the  four vaccine viruses must be avoided or overcome, and neutralizing titres to all four  viruses need to be achieved regardless of the previous immune status of the vaccinated  individuals.",

It is likely that a multicentre trial of a candidate dengue antiviral drug would be indicated,  which raises a series of issues. For instance, the treatment that dengue cases receive  in hospitals is known to have a dramatic effect on the disease outcome, and the way  clinicians treat dengue cases varies greatly both within and between institutions. In  addition, getting physicians to document parameters and outcomes carefully in busy  clinical situations is often difficult – though not impossible – and is clearly essential for  any trial.",

In  addition, getting physicians to document parameters and outcomes carefully in busy  clinical situations is often difficult – though not impossible – and is clearly essential for  any trial. A robust study design with a single protocol followed meticulously at all sites  would solve the problem but would be challenging to achieve. The greatest burden of dengue in most countries is in children, although in some areas  older age groups are also significantly affected. The target population for dengue drugs  would be all age groups but, because of the problematic nature of clinical trials in  children, a drug trial may be better performed in the first instance in adults (>15 years  of age).",
