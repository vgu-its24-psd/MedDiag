However, it also represents  national governments' recognition of the disease burden.

In South-East Asia region, dengue has been reported from all countries except the  Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. The region contributes to more than half of the global  burden of dengue.",

Risk of vertical transmission also increases during pregnancy. Pleural effusion,  ascites and hypotension are commonly associated with dengue in pregnancy. Involvement of lungs  and liver is also common in pregnancy. Patients may have respiratory symptom due to massive  pleural effusion and high SGOT/SGPT due to liver involvement. Complications of dengue depend on  the different stages of pregnancy like early, late, perk partum and postpartum period.    Pregnancy is a state of hyper dynamic circulation, and fluid replacement should be carefully done to  prevent pulmonary oedema.",
