Early recognition and diagnosis of HLH might enable physicians to start the steroid treatment in optimal time, leading to better clinical outcome.[5] Although the mechanism of HLH remains unclear, current accepted theory suggests that inappropriately proliferating and activated T-cells may induce macrophage activation with inadequate intracellular killing of phagocytes.[6] Many studies suggested the important roles of perforin and natural killer (NK) cells in the HLH subtypes.[7–9] Perforin deﬁciency may impair defenses against intracellular pathogens as demonstrated in animal models, whereas decreased NK cell activity results in increased T-cell activation and expansion with production of large quantities of cytokines (IFN-g, TNF–a and GM-CSF), thereby causing sustained macrophage activation.",
